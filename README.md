# Airbnb-NYC

- After achieving the certificate of " Share Data Through the Art of Visualization " within the Google Data Analytics program.
I tried to apply all of what I've learned throughout the last 3 months.

- Excited to share my first dashboard using Tableau ðŸ“Š .

In this project, I used the Airbnb NYC dataset.

First, I took a general look to understand what the data is about.

Then, I wrote the questions that the stakeholder want their answers.

Next, I cleaned and prepared the data.

After that, I analyzed the data to answer my questions.

Next, I made all the visuals to get the general view of the query. 

Then, I prepared the presentation and specified the data and visuals that will be presented , removed the visuals that might confuse the audience, and made sure that the presentation is clear and informative.

Last before sharing my insights, I took feedback from my colleagues who never know about the study.
