# Airbnb-NYC

- After achieving the " Share Data Through the Art of Visualization " certificate within the Google Data Analytics program.
I tried to apply all I've learned throughout the last 3 months.

- Excited to share my first dashboard using Tableau ðŸ“Š .

- In this project, I used the Airbnb NYC dataset.

- First, I took a general look to understand what the data is about.

- Then, I wrote the questions that the stakeholder wanted their answers.

- Next, I cleaned and prepared the data.

- After that, I analyzed the data to answer my questions.

- Next, I made all the visuals to get a general view of the data. 

- Then, I prepared the presentation and specified the data and visuals that would be presented, removed the visuals that might confuse the audience, and made sure that the presentation was clear and informative.

- Last, before sharing my insights, I took feedback from my colleagues who never knew about the study.
